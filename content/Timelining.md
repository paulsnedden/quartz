## Activity - Timelining ([[2023-07-26]])
### Description: 

### Setup: 
Roll of Paper (if In-Person)
Miro Board - https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMzRqWxE=/?share_link_id=662228125782

### Actions: 
Get the big roll of brown paper, and roll it out on the table, or wall or floor if you don’t have a table big enough!

Work out who is the oldest, and draw a mark on the left edge of the "paper" to represent their year of birth.

From this starting date, draw a straight line to the other end of the paper, and mark off the decades to today and for a few years into the future.

Next, get everyone to write down on the line the moments in their lives that are really important:
ie

	When and where you were born
	Where did you live when you were children
	Which schools you went to
	Significant moments in your childhood
	First kiss
	First partner
	Which university you went to
	Death of grandparents
	What was your first job
	Where were you living
	What was the next job
	Why did you leave
	When did you meet your partner
	When did your children get born

All the significant milestones in your life – map them all out on the same piece paper.

Working in and around and over each other, everyone draws their timeline, and then when you’re all done, everyone stands back and each person tells their life story.

It can take a few hours.

You can speed it up by inviting people to tell specific parts of their story: one person tells the first part of their life, and other people will chip in and offer reflections. Then someone else gets to tell the next bit.

It’s rather wonderful if you do give it the proper time it deserves, because you find out all sorts of stuff about each other: what motivated people to do various things in their lives, like moving, or joining organisations, including the current one… it brings you all up to to date.
