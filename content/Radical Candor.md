**Care Personally** - The "Give a Damn" axis.
- Rage isn't a good word, but it is instilled in us since we started working, to be "Professional"...the challenge is to be *more* than just Professional.
- Care Personally (Real, human relationships at work)

**Challenge Directly** - The "Willing to piss people off" axis.
- Manifests as "If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all."
	- Now it's our *job* to say it.
- Silence at one end, Challenge Directly at the other.

### Obnoxious Aggression
"The arsehole quadrant"

### Manipulative Insincerity
Backstabbing
Intolerable
Worst of all the quadrants

### Ruinous Empathy
So concerned about not wanting to hurt feelings, so do nothing

## How to introduce
Get it
Give it
Gauge it
Encourage it
