## Notes
The Kano Model is a way of assessing the impact of services or product features on customer satisfaction. The model says that a product or service is about much more than just functionality â€“ it's also about customers' emotions.

The model assigns three types of attributes (or properties) to products and services: Threshold Attributes, Performance Attributes, and Excitement Attributes. By assigning a product or service to an attribute, you'll be able to determine its impact on customer satisfaction. Let's look at each in more detail:

1. **Threshold Attributes (Basics)**. These are the basic features that customers expect a product or service to have. For example, when you book into a hotel, you'd expect hot water and a bed with clean linen as an absolute minimum.

2. **Performance Attributes (Satisfiers)**. These elements are not absolutely necessary, but they increase a customer's enjoyment of the product or service. Returning to our example, you'd be pleased to discover that your hotel room had free superfast broadband and a 4K TV, when you'd normally expect to find paid-for Wi-Fi and a standard TV.

3. **Excitement Attributes (Delighters)**. These are the surprise elements that can really boost your product's competitive edge . They're the features that customers don't even know they want, but are delighted with when they find them.
