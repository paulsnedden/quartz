## Activity - Three Chairs ([[2023-02-28]])
### Description: 
To illustrate some different cultural communication styles and begin a discussion of how communication styles affect us in our communication with others, especially those from different cultural backgrounds. 

### Setup: 
#### Target Audience:
This activity is for groups starting to learn about working or doing business across cultures. This exercise is done in triads (groups of 3).

#### Time:
5 minutes to set up and introduce the activity, minimum 2 minutes per round (with 3 rounds), and a 5 -10 minutes to debrief at the end. 

### Actions: 
Three chairs are set up, the outer two turned toward the inner one. The chair on the left holds the position of the "expert"; the middle chair, the "listener"; and the right chair is the "real story". A relevant topic is assigned, such as “Life in the United States.” The expert person and the real story person talk to the listener simultaneously, while the listener tries to listen and respond to both, as best they can. The two talkers are competing for the listener's attention, and the goal is for the listener to see which talker holds their attention more. The Expert talks as if he/she is a specialist and he/she may cite statistics, give factual information, etc. The Real Story person is the one who speaks as if they're someone you met on the street. He or she can tell a true story from their life or even make up a story related to topic. The story should be "personal." After 2 minutes, call time and then rotate chairs and repeat the procedure with each person in a different role. After 2 more minutes, rotate chairs one more time and repeat. 

#### Other variations:
After the 2 chairs talk simultaneously, you could then have participants practice
listening to one at a time. You could also assign conversation styles to the different roles – ie the “Real Story” person could talk excitedly and loudly using hand gestures. The “Expert” person could talk more quietly with minimal gestures, with or without eye contact. 

### Debrief:
This activity illustrates different communication styles: Two persons talking at once could be an example from a polychromic culture. Factual vs. personal information is indicative of another style of communicating. As you debrief, discuss which "chair" they found themselves listening and responding to more attentively. You can then discuss how different techniques/styles can be used to help communicate from different perspectives/cultural backgrounds. You can also discuss how one’s own communication style might make one more apt to internalize information presented according to one approach or the other.
