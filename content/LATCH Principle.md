### Location
Maps, Atlases, Flight schedules, trains, historical sites
Useful when data is influenced by geography or way-finding

### Alphabet
Dictionaries, Encyclopedias
Useful when data is non-linear and when no other strategies are available

### Time
Calendars, Time tables, recipes, Ikea assembly instructions
Useful when data is displayed and compared over fixed intervals/durations. 

### Category
Museum archives, catalogues, period table
Useful when seeking data based on known groupings

### Hierarchy
Taxonomy, weights, heights
Useful when data can be compared by common measures

## Supermarket example
Store is **location**
Aisles are **category**
Product Ranges are **hierarchy**
Products are **alphabet** and **time** (use by dates)
