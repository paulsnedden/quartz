# RACI - [[2022-09-03]]
## Notes
Clarify roles and responsibilities of the [[Team]] and [[Stakeholders]]. The RACI model of **Responsible** (get it done), **Accountable** (owns final decision), **Consulted** (Seek input from), and **Informed** (notified only) helps you define how various activities will be handled cross-teams. This is especially valuable in the situation you have multiple teams and disciplines and levels of involvement.
