## Activity - Code Names ([[2023-05-30]])
### Description: 
A game for collaboration

**Run your imagination in the wildest word associations!**
Two rival spymasters know the secret identities of 25 agents. Their teammates know the agents only by their codenames. To win the game, your team will need to contact all of your agents in the field before the other team finds their own agents. And watch out for the assassin – meet him in the field and your team is done!

Codenames is simple to explain and easy to understand, with no limit to size of the teams – you can play in four people as well as in twelve!
