## Activity - Human Alphabet ([[2023-08-29]])
### Description: 
Participants learn to work together, which can build relationships and connections.

### Setup: 
Need a big space and some music

### Actions: 

Put some music on and ask participants to walk around the room.

Explain that you are going to randomly stop the music and call out a number. When you do this, they need to form themselves into groups of the number you have called out and then sit down.

When everyone is sitting in groups of approximately the right number (the total number of participants may not divide equally into the number called), call out a letter of the alphabet.

Explain that they must use their bodies as a group to form the letter. All participants must be part of the letter, which can be in upper or lower case.

Repeat the process by asking the participants to resume walking around the area to music.
