## Activity - Scissors Paper Rock Tournament ([[2022-03-15]])
### Description: 
This is a fun and loud energiser based on the well-known “Scissors, Paper, Rock” game - with a twist: the losing players become the fan of the winners as the winner advances to the next round. This goes on until a final showdown with two large cheering crowds!

It can be played with adults of all levels as well as kids and it always works! 

### Setup: 
The basic rules of "Scissors, Paper, Rock" are the following: 

The players count to 3. On 3 they form one out of 3 symbols with their hands: 

1) "Rock" – the fist

2) "Paper" – the straight hand

3) "Scissors" – index and middle-finger pointing out

Each symbol wins and loses against one other symbol:

"Rock" breaks the "Scissors".

"Scissors" cuts the "Paper".

"Paper" wraps the "Rock"


### Actions: 
1. Find a partner

2. Play "Scissors, Paper, Rock" against each other until the first win.

3. The winner has to find a new opponent. The losing player becomes a fan of the winner. 

4. The winner plays against the new opponent, while their fan cheers for them. 

5. The winner of the second game searches for a new opponent, while the losing team joins their fan base. 

6. Repeat until there are only two opponents with a huge fan base cheering for them. The last two have to play until one player has won 2 times.
