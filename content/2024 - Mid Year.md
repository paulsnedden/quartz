# 2024 - Mid Year - [[2024-01-30]]
## Notes
The last 6 months of 2023 proved to be very interesting. I transitioned from supporting a single Tribe in the People Team to now providing support across 3 distinct and very different Tribes. Coupled with this was the introduction of Relative Sizing (T-Shirts) and Prioritisation (MoSCoW) practices to help the People Team to alleviate some of the ongoing pressures of capacity management. The general feedback from the Tribes that I support is that they will not resolve the problems, that they can pause work as required to solve capacity, and that work can be deprioritised on a whim. There is clearly more to do in this space, as VOT would suggest a very different story.

For TE, I co-designed and piloted a brand new Agile Foundations program during Q1. Similar to the training from the Big W Families program, Agile Foundations has proven to be energising and informative at the same time. I have since engaged the assistance of all ATFs in TE (GAP) as well as four ATFs in WooliesX and one in the People Team to facilitate in 2024. This means I can concentrate on management of the program, feedback and continuous improvement - it also means less time commitment ongoing, a bonus in every respect.

Along with the new Agile Foundations program, I also co-piloted a new ATF Growth Circle with a group of ATFs from People, wiq, W360, F&V and Supers. The sessions were very adhoc in nature, which resulted in some very positive feedback concerning structure. This has resulted in a redesigned program, now called the ATF Growth Hub. This will be piloted in late Q3, and will consist of ATFs from across the business who do not have an Agile Coach supporting them.

I began work in both the IDF and OKR projects, to assist in transitioning this work from another Coach. Both have been slow going and not without their own challenges. This piece of work will continue into H2.

As always, I put out a brief survey to my stakeholders during both Q1 and Q2 so that I could garner feedback on myself as an Agile Coach and the services I provide. The overall personal NPS that I received was 9.25 / 10, which I am very proud and honoured to see. This has slightly improved from the EOY score of 9.0, and demonstrates the relationship I have with stakeholders and their respective teams. From the feedback provided, an area I need to work on is to better "focus on less things to have greater impact". I see this as representing my need to develop a better understanding of the business needs of the teams and stakeholders I work with, rather than diving head-long into a predisposed idea that I may have in mind. This will allow me to only concentrate my time on the opportunities where I can be of the most value. The Agile Advocacy has dropped from 9.0 to 8.75, which can be attributed to the earlier comment regarding Estimation and Prioritisation.

From a personal perspective, I was honoured to have been inducted into Miro's Hall of Fame as their very first Global Advocate of the Year. I see this as great recognition for all the work I have done in ensuring that Woolworths team members have a great base of knowledge in using this tool and has been a excellent opportunity to develop myself as a public speaker, facilitator and coach. This piece of work will continue through 2024, but the vast majority occurs outside of standard working hours and does not impact my role within Woolworths to any great extent.

I look to the near future with great anticipation. Moving into a Senior Agile Enablement Partner role has been slower than I expected, but I am confident this will be closed out in Q3. "Agile" is in a very interesting place within Woolworths, as a lot of the team feel they 'know' everything there is to know about agile. When questioned, this always results in discussions around Jira, standups and Miro. Clearly, we have a lot more work to do.
