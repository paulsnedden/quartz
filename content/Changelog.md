# Changelog - [[2023-01-23]]
## Notes
- [[2022-01-25]] Removed _template name_ references from all templates as it was making the templates themselves far too large in the [[Graph View]]
- [[2022-02-01]] Started adding more Tags into notes
- [[2022-02-09]] Now synching work calendar with Obsidian, to auto-populate daily agenda! BOOM SHAKA LAKA
- [[2022-02-11]] Worked with Schnitz to further refine the sync, now auto-populating agenda AND MeetingNote(s) for each. DailyNote now pulls agenda as a *dataview*, so no more having to manually create agenda. Also removed Kanban Board after refining DailyNote.
- [[2022-02-17]] Further tweaks to the script/sync. Each Meeting Note now has a "sorted" list of attendees, grouped by YES, NO, and INVITED. Next step is to create a spreadsheet of all names/emails, as contacts in Google don't always show the person's name when using getName.
- [[2022-02-24]] Added new template, TeamTemplate, to capture key information about an engagement both formal and informal. Also fixed the agenda in DailyNote so it only shows meetings. Moved "other" notes to the Notes and Actions section. Also added Related Notes section to show any other note that references "today" but was not Created today
- [[2022-02-26]] Added a calc of meeting duration. Longer term plan will be to have a calc of totalMeetingTime per day
- [[2022-02-27]] slight tweaks to Agenda and Related Notes. Stopped using date(today) because that's just silly when trying to look into the past. Instead, changed both to look at date(this.file.name). Great Success.
- [[2022-05-03]] removed Tasks from DailyNote and replaced it with [[My Board]]. Tasks was scouring /Work and was taking a long time, so it would only get worse over time. Keeping them separate is a better long-term solution, as long as I use it. I did like the ability to quickly add a task via the hashtag (or ctrl-q). Might be a way of creating a hotkey to add something into the To Do status of the kanban board.
- [[2022-05-04]] I was right with my previous assumption. Using the QuickAdd plugin, turned ctrl-shift-q into a hotkey that would produce a popup to add directly into ToDo column of [[My Board]]. Also setup a Tasker task on my phone to write directly to [[My Board]] as well.
- [[2022-06-24]] tweak to [[Daily Note Template]] to show edits from entire repository, except for MeetingNotes and DailyNotes
- [[2022-06-28]] tweak to [[Daily Note Template]] as I left out ! in "contains(Tags, "DailyNote")" (as in, not contains)
- [[2022-07-27]] made some mods to the gApps script to now include Meeting Owner in [[Meeting Note Template]]. At some point since [[2022-05-24]] I stopped using the [[My Board]] as I moved everything into [Jira](https://woolworths-agile.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/PAUL/boards/3869?selectedIssue=PAUL-513&quickFilter=7507)
- [[2022-08-02]] slight tweak to [[Meeting Note Template]] to remove "Tribe" because I wasn't using it. Changed it to "Title" to add meeting name to metadata
- [[2022-08-05]] added DOB to [[Person Template]] as front matter, to then be pulled into [[Daily Note Template]]. Requires yyyy-mm-yy, but I will just use the year I added the DOB (as I find out). eg 2022-08-15 for me. Now need to go thru all my people notes to move it from text into front matter. Thankfully, there shouldn't be many. 
- [[2022-09-22]] Also created [[Birthdays]] to give the complete list of who I have got so far.
- [[2022-11-24]] Added a very cool Dashboard thing to [[Daily Note Template]] that shows vault info, including most-recent files edited, count of files with a particular tag (using # ToDo iin my setup) and counts of bits of data (total files, total people, total notes in a folder - eg Work). Also added a cssclass ("Dashboard") to the [[Daily Note Template]] to format the Dashboard thing a bit, but doesn't seem to work yet.
- [[2022-11-25]] Added default templates for Work, Meeting and DailyNotes folders. also, now any new files created will have a [[Default Template]] added
- [[2022-11-29]] removed [[Work/Squad]] from [[Meeting Note Template]] and replaced it with [[Project]], to better articulate and group the things I'm working on.
- [[2022-11-30]] made some tweaks to [[Obsidian Calendar Sync]] script to accommodate changes to templates. 
- [[2022-12-02]] Removed the Vault info from the [[Daily Note Template]] as the file had to be in Reading mode to be able to see it.
- [[2022-12-19]] based on a YT video I saw, I made an update to how the Local Graph displays....documenting here so I can recreate
	- Groups:
		- tag:#MeetingNote
		- tag:#People
		- tag:#DailyNote
	- Filters:
		- Incoming Links ON
		- Outgoing Links ON
		- Neighbour Links ON (this is important)
		- Tags ON
		- Depth: 2
		- Search "-tag:MeetingNote"
			- THIS is the most-important step of all. It removes Meeting Notes from the graph, otherwise it would get super crowded and slow
			- Could/should probably remove Daily Note as well, but keeping in for now.
- [[2023-01-13]] Happy New Year. Four updates:
	- Added filter "-tag:MeetingNote" as a toggle, as sometimes the local graph is extremely busy (like from this page)
	- I made a slight tweak to the update above, to now include tag:#Note.
	- Accompanying this is that Meeting Notes are now moved into a seperate file with tag:Note. The OG MeetingNote now only includes invitees and relevant metadata
	- Added the creation of the link to the Note in the [[Obsidian Calendar Sync]] script.
- [[2023-01-23]] [[Changelog]] moved to its own file
- [[2023-01-29]] moved meeting notes to /Meeting Notes and tweaked the script to accommodate creation in Meeting note. Also had to remove default location for new files, as I had /Work there and it was creating /Work/Meeting Notes/note.md every time. Removing that means the setup in QuickAdd and Templater now work correctly, as will the script.
- [[2023-01-30]] more tweaks. I changed #People to #Person in the [[Person Template]] and all current people, as People is the new team I'm working with and I don't want to confuse things. Also, for some reason, /Meeting Notes/ stopped working so I removed it from the script and all references in today's notes. I hope this doesn't backflip again as it will be a PITA to keep repairing as notes grow. Lastly, the dv script in [[Daily Note Template]] , linked to [[Birthdays]], is broken for some reason. Initial thought was that it was the hashtag mentioned above, but changing that in the dv script hasn't fixed it. A reindex of the dirtybase hasn't helped either. That's a February problem.
- [[2023-02-20]] Added a script that adds a profile photo to a [[Person Template]]. It uses a frontmatter called linkedinphoto and a piece of code in the template itself to pull in their LI photo into their person file. **Nice!** Also added [] to some frontmatter, to allow dataview lookups. eg Tags[0] is the first Tag, Tags[1], would be 2nd, and so on. Using that for Tags, Teams and Notes seems useful, but will rely on a particular order rather than a "contains" query
- [[2023-03-20]] so much has happened in the last month. I've added a few more plugins and changed things around in terms of WoW. Now my "home" is [[Dashboard.canvas]], which gives me everything on a single screen, rather than a long scrollable Daily Note. The Daily Note is still used/created for Tasks, but they don't need to be. The other useful thing is Metadata Menu, which allows for clickable entry of frontmatter, rather than hard-coding it every time. It broke 1on1 dataview query in People notes, because it added "[ [ and ]]" to the Name field (because it's a link). A bit of playing around fixed it. I will need to go back and refit this into all previous People notes, but I'll also put it in [[person template]]
- [[2023-05-07]] implemented a google apps script to auto-move Meeting Notes to /Meetings/[yyyy] every Friday night. Doing this because it was taking too long to browse to /Meetings with all files since 2021 in it.
- [[2023-06-09]] after watching [a Youtube video](https://youtu.be/d8plJSJYqVw), I made a bunch of changes to [[Dashboard]] and thus the [[Dashboard.canvas|Dashboard]] Canvas. In short, dataviewjs ftw. The tasks that make up each Objective are now included in the Objectives panel. A new section called "Unscheduled Tasks" will now pull in all non-completed inline tasks ([ ]) - this will also ignore any #task in the same files.
