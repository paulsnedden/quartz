## Notes

Here are 5 Savvy Communication Lessons I Wish I Learned Sooner:

1. Empathy > Expertise
People remember how you made them feel over what you knew. Instead of striving to be the most knowledgeable, focus on being the most understanding.

2. Admit ‘Ignorance’
Responding with “I don’t know” when you genuinely don’t demonstrates authenticity and humility. View ‘not knowing’ as an opportunity to be curious and learn.

3. Compliment with Depth
Instead of simply praising appearances, offer genuine compliments about character or actions. It shows you truly see the person. Instead of, “I like your jacket,” try, “I appreciate how you always go out of your way to help others. Your kindness is inspiring.”

4. Offer the Right Role
Instead of immediately jumping into advice mode, ask the LPB question: "Do you need a Listening ear, Problem solver, or Brainstorm partner?" This shows your willingness to provide the support they actually need.

5. Critique Carefully
Constructive feedback can build trust when delivered tactfully. Focus on the issue, not the person, and offer solutions. 
A useful framework is:
“When you **situation**, I feel **impact**, and I would like **desired outcome**. How can we get there?”
