Recognising and reflecting on mistakes is the key to not repeating them. That’s the principle behind Hansei.

_**Hansei**_ (English: Self-reflection): To recognise mistakes and take appropriate action to avoid re-occurrence.

Even if a task is completed successfully, Toyota recognises the need for a hansei-kai, or reflection meeting; a process that helps to identify failures experienced along the way and create clear plans for future efforts. An inability to identify issues is usually seen as an indication that you did not stretch to meet or exceed expectations, that you were not sufficiently critical or objective in your analysis, or that you lack modesty and humility. Within the process, no problem is itself a problem.

Continual reflection is a requirement for all Toyota members and one way this takes place is through [[Genchi Genbutsu]].
