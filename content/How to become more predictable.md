# How to become more predictable - [[2023-02-06]]
## Notes
How to become "more predictable" as an agile team:

* Work smaller
* Work together
* Work on less at once
* Start finishing, stop starting
* Regularly integrate your work
* Get feedback "early and often"
* Diverge at first
* Allow the design to emerge
* Focus on flow, adapt scope to time constraints
* Commitment to continuous improvement and learning
* Focus on support systems and tools
* Celebrate wins, build in some down-time
* Visualize the flow of work, bottlenecks, etc.
* Don't worry about predictability. It is a byproduct
