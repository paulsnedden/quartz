# Focusing on customer value and business outcomes over activity and outputs - [[2022-11-15]]
## Notes
Source: https://agilemarketingmanifesto.org/

When we prioritize customer and business needs we create more targeted and relevant marketing programs. In other words, creating the 'right things' vs 'more things'.

It's easy to fall into the trap of doing marketing activities just to do them with our value #1, we really hone in on what will provide the most value to our customers and how that can impact the business downstream.
