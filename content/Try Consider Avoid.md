# Try Consider Avoid - [[2023-04-26]]
## Notes
Mentioned to me by [[Christian Van Stom|CVS]] during our 1on1

**Try** is all about doing or suggesting the things you know will work, you've done them before.

**Consider** is introducing some unknowns, things outside the norm. The grey area.

**Avoid** is the things that should not be attempted, as you know they will fail based on experience.
