# Plan and Align 
<https://sites.google.com/woolworths.com.au/quaterlyplanning/our-planning-rhythm?pli=1&authuser=1> is the official site for all information regarding [[Big Room Planning]]. 

	Plan & Align occurs at the business level about 2 weeks before the Quarter starts. While Plan & Align will look a little different in each Business, the outcome of bringing teams together to align on work to be done remains the same. Itâ€™s a chance to ask the teams HOW we will do the work and what capacity is required and available. Some Businesses will also address risks and dependencies.

	Based on what we discover at Plan & Align, we will refine the QBR Memo further.

[[Plan and Align]] differs from [[Big Room Planning]] in that BRP is for teams to do [[Sprint]]-level planning for each[[Work/Squad]].
