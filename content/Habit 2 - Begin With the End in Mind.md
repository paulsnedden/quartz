# Habit 2 - Begin With the End in Mind - [[2023-09-20]]
## Notes

Highly effective people have a clear vision of what they want to achieve in life. They know what they want to be, do, and have. This vision guides their decisions and helps them to stay focused on their goals.

To begin with the end in mind, you need to:

- Create a personal [[mission statement]] that defines your values and goals.
- Develop a vision for your future in all areas of your life, including your career, relationships, health, and finances.
- Set specific and measurable goals ( [[SMART]] ) that are aligned with your vision.
