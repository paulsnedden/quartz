# Agile Leadership Team Principles - [[2022-03-02]]
## Notes
As Leaders, We Always Strive to:
- Keep a transparent strategy and facilitate a pull-based backlog for teams to self organise around value - NOT pushing things to the teams, or micromanaging.
- Give a clear direction and share WHY we are doing things to enable new learnings to impact the WHAT - NOT deciding on the solution.
- Manage structures around the teams so that they can make quick and smart decisions - NOT managing the people.
- Act as sponsors by asking "What do you need to succeed" and actively remove impediments - NOT acting as a steering group and only following up results or making decisions on the team's behalf.
- Empower the people and foster a culture of [[psychological safety]] to enable initiative, experimentation, and problem solving together - NOT stepping-in to solve everyday, low-risk problems so teams can become increasingly mature.
- Empower teams and individuals to build the capabilities needed to take responsibility for delivering value continuously NOT taking the responsibility from them, and not only optimising for short-term goals.
