The [[Toyota Production System]] is focused completely around maximum efficiency and fault-free processes. That’s the idea behind _Poka-Yoke_.

_**Poka-Yoke**_ (English: mistake-proofing): Fail safe devices in the production process that automatically stop the line in case of an error.

A _Poka-Yoke_ is any part of a manufacturing process that helps a Toyota member avoid (_yokeru_) mistakes (_poka_).

Its purpose is to eliminate defects by preventing, correcting, or highlighting errors as they occur – for example, a jig that holds parts for processing might be modified to only allow them to be held in the correct arrangement. In a wider sense, the term can refer to any behaviour-shaping constraint designed into a process to prevent incorrect operation by the user.

Mistake-proofing is a part of the [[continuous improvement]] philosophy, or _[[Kaizen]]_.
