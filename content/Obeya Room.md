# Obeya Room - [[2022-09-19]]
## Notes
An Obeya (Japanese for “big room”) is a room set up to get employees out of their offices and cubicles and into a central location where they can meet, discuss key information, and solve problems.

The idea behind an Obeya is to break down the barriers that prevent employees from collaborating and sharing information to make efficient decisions.

Obeyas are most effective when established and outfitted to solve problems or work on specific projects.
