# Habit 1 - Be Proactive - [[2023-09-20]]
## Notes

Proactive people take responsibility for their own lives and choices. They don't blame others or their circumstances for their problems. Instead, they focus on what they can control and take action to make things better.

Proactive people are characterized by the following traits:

- They are aware of their [[Circle of Influence]], which is the things they can control, and their [[Circle of Concern]], which is the things they cannot control. They focus their energy on their [[Circle of Influence]].
- They make commitments to themselves and stick to them.
- They are responsible for their own happiness and well-being.
