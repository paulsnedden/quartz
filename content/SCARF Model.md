# SCARF Model - [[2022-04-06]]
## Notes
[Neuro Leadership](neuroleadership.com)

### Model Explained
**Status**:
If status one of your strongest drivers, you are naturally competitive. You love winning but hate coming second. It might be having the highest sales record, or the owning the latest technology or throwing the most exuberant party that drives you. It could be beating your personal best. Whatever it is, being ‘top’ is key. It’s important to you to feel highly respected in the workplace.
Look for projects and roles that offer you clear opportunities to continue advancing.
Be aware of the pitfalls that may come with a competitive spirit. You might find yourself continuing an argument simply for the sake of winning. Or you might easily be bored if the challenge is missing.

**Certainty**:
When you are sensitive to certainty, you like things planned well in advance and you don’t like last minute changes. You have a natural affinity with systems and processes. You are a “list person” and often find yourself the organizer in social and work situations.
Be aware that you may naturally limit yourself from doing new (and therefore uncertain) things, even those that could be good for you, like learning new tasks or travelling. You may also react very strongly when people leave things to the last minute or constantly change their mind.
To feel more certainty rewards and fewer threats ask questions to make sure you are clear on expectations. Don’t wait for others to come to you.

**Autonomy**:
When autonomy is important, you like being in the driver’s seat. You like calling the shots, and having a feeling of choice when it comes to the work you do.
Be aware that you may say no to things simply because they are not your idea. You may also need to remember to give other people the opportunity to choose from time to time.
If autonomy is a strong driver for you, ask for where you can have clear autonomy so you can exercise this. And watch out for tasks where you have to follow other people's orders precisely.

**Relatedness**:
If relatedness is one of your strongest drivers, you always make the effort socially and hate it when others don’t. You find it easy to connect with others and love doing things that make others feel important and special.
Be aware that you may expect more from your friends and colleagues that they can give. You may find yourself easily offended when people don’t respond to invitations or get back to you with answers.
To increase reward and reduce threat around relatedness, look for opportunities to connect with others who are important to you. This could be joining a sporting team, organizing an interest group, or phoning family at a certain time each week. Watch out for situations that isolate you from others – such as working on your own.

**Fairness**:
If fairness is important to you, you are happy to be beaten by a better player but hate someone who cheats the system. People who jump the queue really get under your skin, but you’ll sign up to a roster that ensures everyone contributes equally.
Be aware that you might find yourself always speaking up for others when sometimes it’s okay just to let things slide. Fairness tends to dominate all areas of our lives, so in your relationships make room for other feelings such as simply caring for others.
To create more reward and less threat around the domain of fairness, look for ways to get involved. Knowing how decisions are made, or having a say in the process will help. This might be through a career in HR, social justice or policy creation, or getting involved in your community.
