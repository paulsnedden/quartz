# User Stories - [[2022-04-29]]
## Notes
- Stories aren't a written form of requirements; telling stories through collaboration with words and pictures is a mechanism that builds shared understanding
- Stories aren't the requirements; they're discussions about driving problems for our organisation, our customers, and our users that lead to agreements on what to "build"
- Our job isn't to build more widgets faster; it's too maximise the outcome and impact we get from what we choose to build
