## Activity - Big Hitter Moments ([[2022-07-25]])
### Description: 
This activity gets participants guessing each others "big hitter moments" (a moment when they shined during the timebox)

### Setup: 
Cards or sticky notes (tow different colours if possible)
Enough pens for each participant

### Actions: 
1. Give each participant two cards of different colours and a pen
2. On the first card, hidden from others, they should write their own "big hitter" moment (a special moment during the timebox in which they were involved and proud of)
3. On the second card, they write their name at the top and place it face down in the middle of the table
4. Once all team members have placed their second card in the middle, shuffle them, and then each participant takes a name card from the pile (ensuring they don't end up with their own)
5. On this card, they will write what they think is the big hitter moment for the teammate whose name is on the card.
6. Once all the name cards are completed with a big hitter, a team member reads out the name at the top of the card and their guess at the big hitter moment.
7. The named person then reads out what their big hitter moment actually was.
8. Applause for matches
9. Continue until all big hitter moments are completed (6-8)

*This activity helps to foster celebration in the team. Not only does each person have to think about their own moment, they also get to hear compliments from others.*
