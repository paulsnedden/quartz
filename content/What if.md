# What if - [[2023-01-09]]
## Notes
From: [[Embedding a Culture of Innovation]]

### Step 1 - List the rules as they currently are
Don't think about them
Just write them down
If you think about them, you'll start to think about all the reasons **why** you can't break them.

### Step 2 - Pick one and ask the most-audacious question
WHAT IF....

The more-audacious, the more chance of you getting outside the banks of your [[Rivers of Thinking]]
