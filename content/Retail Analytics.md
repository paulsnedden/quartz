# DAI - [[2022-02-24]]
## Summary
Two squads ([[Customer Squad]] and [[Product and Operations Squad]])
Tech Leads ([[Kai Cheah]] and [[Martin Stevenson]]) attend all sessions
P/T [[Scrum Master]] - [[Richard Forsyth]], working Monday and Friday only

Each squad has a [[Product Owner]]
- [[Megna Murali]] for [[Customer Squad]]
- [[Jeremy Walker]] for [[Product and Operations Squad]]

Each squad has a DAI Partner
- [[Kelly Griffin]] for [[Product and Operations Squad]]
* [[David Clugston]] for [[Customer Squad]]

Previous Agile Coach set them up to use [[Scrum]] as their delivery framework.

## Analysis
Because of [[Richard Forsyth]]'s work schedule, all [[Scrum]] events occur on a Monday and Friday
[[Sprint Planning]] is the longest event, at 45 minutes for each squad
[[Daily Standup]] occurs on Monday, Wednesday and Friday for [[Product and Operations Squad]], and Tuesday and Thursday for [[Customer Squad]]. 
[[Sprint Retrospective]] for each squad is on Friday afternoons, at 30 minutes each. They're not very effective, which is partly due to the inexperience of [[Richard Forsyth]] but also because they simply not long enough.
Work is pretty much Service Desk

## High Level Plan
[[Kanban]] is a better candidate here.
To minimise disruption, initial recommendation is to break squads apart in terms of sprint events. Each squad to have all events on alternate Mondays???
Let that settle in for a while before the move to Kanban
[[Duncan Middlebrook]] and [[Kai Cheah]] aren't against it. Talking to Customer Squad next.

*Update - [[2022-09-15]]*
[[Kelly Griffin]] has taken over as HO, once [[Duncan Middlebrook]] left. Kelly has been in-place since April?
All squads now using [[Kanban (TPS)]] as their delivery framework
Now expanded from 3 to 7 squads. Each squad has a designated [[ATF]], all brought together as [[Family 8]]
My engagement is now coming to an end, so I can do more work with [[Marketing]]
