# The 5 Dysfunctions of a Team - [[2023-07-26]]
## Notes

**DYSFUNCTION #1: ABSENCE OF TRUST**

The fear of being vulnerable prevents team members from building trust with each other.

The root cause of lack of trust lies with team members being unable to be vulnerable and open with one another. This is a huge waste of time and energy, as team members invest in defensive behaviour instead, and are reluctant to ask for help from – or assist – each other.

**DYSFUNCTION #2: FEAR OF CONFLICT**

The desire to preserve artificial harmony stifles productive ideological conflict within the team.

Teams that are lacking trust are incapable of having an unfiltered, passionate debate about things that matter, causing team members to avoid conflict, replacing it with an artificial harmony.

**DYSFUNCTION #3: LACK OF COMMITMENT**

The lack of clarity and/or buy-in prevents team members from making decisions they stick to.

Without conflict, it is not easy for team members to commit and buy-in to decisions, resulting in an environment where ambiguity prevails.

**DYSFUNCTION #4: AVOIDANCE OF ACCOUNTABILITY**

The need to avoid interpersonal discomfort prevents team members from holding each other accountable for their behaviours and performance.

When teams don’t commit, you can’t have accountability: “people aren’t going to hold each other accountable if they haven’t clearly bought into the plan”.

**DYSFUNCTION #5: INATTENTION TO RESULTS**

The pursuit of individual goals and personal status erodes the team's focus on collective success.

A team can only become results-oriented when all team members place the team’s results first. When individuals aren’t held accountable, team members naturally tend to look out for their own interests, rather than the interests of the team.
