## Notes

When we experiment, we learn and collect data. That data and learned results enables us to make better and more effective marketing decisions.

If we ignore the data and only rely on someone's opinion or an outdated convention, then we underserve our audiences and spend valuable time producing the wrong things.

It is a process of validating our learning through a implement-measure-learn feedback loop, rather than of following conventions or deciding whatâ€™s best based on the opinion of the highest paid person in the room (HIPPO).
