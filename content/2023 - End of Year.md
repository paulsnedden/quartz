# 2023 - End of Year - [[2023-07-03]]
## Notes
What a year. As I mentioned in my 1/2 yearly reflection, almost 4 fantastic years with Big W, I transitioned to another part of the Group. Upon reflection, I must say that I'm very glad that I did. Working in a Tribe within the People Team has allowed me to focus on what a Transformation Delivery Partner should be doing, which is to optimise the system wherever possible. In the past 6 months with the My Career Ecosystems Platforms. Working with such a fantastic group of Coaches has allowed me to both grow and challenge my own perceptions and thinking, to help our teams become the best they can be.

My main objective for H2 for the MyCEP Tribe was to enable their ways of working at scale. This manifested in a number of ways. 
- First and foremost was working with the Tribe Lead of a portfolio view of work (both in Jira and Miro). The MVP of this is complete and is being tested by the Tribe LT, and will require additional support in Q1. 
- Secondly, I've been coaching the ATFs to take on a more pro-active approach to facilitation of Tribe events. This began with me simply asking one of the ATFs if they would like to step in for me as I was going to be on leave for one of the Tribe Council meetings. He agreed and did a fantastic job. This will continue through Q1 as there have been a number of changes in ATFs during Q4 due to maternity leave and team member changes in squads. Ideally, I would like an ATF to facilitate each Tribe Council (or Standup) as it will help to bolster their own development.

Turning to GroupTE objectives,...

- I successfully piloted the revised Agile Foundations training program. The revised program is based on the Training from the Back of the Room method, making it interactive and 'fun' for participants - this was as a direct result from previous sessions, where participants felt that the training was quite "dry". Feedback received during the session, and colloquially at the end of the session, was that the training was engaging and useful.
- I completed the revision work of the current GAP google site, to allow for a transition to TeamSpace
- An objective I had coming out of the H1 connection with the NZ Coaches was to enable further connection between the two countries. This has been moulded over time into two separate objectives - one for the Advocates Guild and one for the broader agile Practice. The cross-guild connection was completed in June 2023, and the coach-related one will be occurring in Q1 F24.


My personal NPS scored a 9.0 from respondents. I'm very proud of this, as I believe it demonstrates my passion and commitment to helping others achieve their best.

I'm committed to continuing my journey as a Transformation Delivery Partner, with an Agile Coaching speciality.
