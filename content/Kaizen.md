_Kaizen_ is one of the core principles of The [[Toyota Production System]], a quest for [[continuous improvement]] and a single word that sums up Toyota’s ‘Always a Better Way’ slogan.

_**Kaizen**_ (English: Change for the better, or [[Continuous improvement]]): A philosophy that helps to ensure maximum quality, the elimination of [[waste]], and improvements in efficiency, both in terms of equipment and work procedures. _Kaizen_ improvements in standardised work help maximise productivity at every worksite. Standardised work involves following procedures consistently and therefore employees can identify the problems promptly.

Within the [[Toyota Production System]], _Kaizen_ humanises the workplace, empowering individual members to identify areas for improvement and suggest practical solutions. The focused activity surrounding this solution is often referred to as a _kaizen blitz_, while it is the responsibility of each member to adopt the improved standardised procedure and eliminate [[waste]] from within the local environment.

_Kaizen_ begins in the early designs of a production line and continues through its lifetime of use by a process of consensus known as _**[[Nemawashi]]**_.
