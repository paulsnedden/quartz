### ROAMing Risks
**Resolved**: The risk is determined to not be a threat at this time. No further action is 
required.

**Owned**: The risk cannot be resolved within the meeting, so a member of the team is 
selected to ‘own’ the handling of that risk. This person is responsible for making sure 
that this risk is appropriately managed.

**Accepted**: The risk cannot be resolved, so it must be accepted as-is and dealt with as 
necessary.

**Mitigated**: A plan needs to be formulated (during the session) to eliminate the threat of the risk.
