# The [[Agile]] [[Marketing]] [[Manifesto]] - [[2022-11-15]]
## Notes
Source: https://agilemarketingmanifesto.org/
For [[Work/Marketing]] 

To keep up with the speed and complexity of marketing today, we are adopting new ways of working:

1 - [[Focusing on customer value and business outcomes over activity and outputs ]]

2 - [[Delivering value early and often over waiting for perfection]] 

3 - [[Learning through experiments and data over opinions and conventions]] 

4 - [[Cross-Functional Collaboration Over Silos and Hierarchies]]

5 - [[Responding to change over following a static plan]]
