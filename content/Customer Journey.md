# Customer Journey - [[2022-09-19]]
## Notes
A customer journey map is a visual representation of the customer journey (also called the buyer journey or user journey).

It helps you tell the story of your customersâ€™ experiences with your brand across all touchpoints.

Whether your customers interact with you via social media, email, live chat or other channels, mapping the customer journey out visually helps ensure no customer slips through cracks.
