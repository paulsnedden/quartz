# Design Thinking - [[2022-10-13]]
## Notes
[[What Design Thinking is NOT]]
[[What does good Design Thinking look like]]

Design Thinking, at its core, is a 5 step/stage process for innovation:
![[Design Thinking.png]]
### Stage 1 - Empthasize
research your users' needs.
understand the people you're trying to design the process/solution for.
Personas, Interviews, Surveys, etc.
Ask: What do these people do?

### Stage 2 - Define
state your users' needs and problems.
Take everyone from Step 1 and break iit down and form conclusions.
Ask: What are the challenges?
Ask: What insights can we use?
Needs as Verbs, not Nouns
- eg Don't need a Ladder to get the book off the top shelf. Instead, need is to reach higher. Solution _could_ be a ladder, _could_ be a pogo stick, _could_ be a bionic arm

[[Point of View Statements]]


### Stage 3 - Ideate
challenge assumptions and create ideas.
Potential matches of products/services with the insights.
[[Brainstorming]]. [[HMW]] sessions.

Example Activities: [[SCAMPER]] or [[Crazy 8s]]

### Stage 4 - Prototype
start to create solutions.
Testable prototypes. NOT complete, something that can be tested.
[[MVP]] is important here.

Two important points:
- Fail Early
- Test Often

### Stage 5 - Test
try your solutions out.
Test with real people (from Step 1)
Get realtime feedback

**The important thing to understand is that the 5 steps are a "zoomed out map", but the exact exercises of what to do in each step are not defined.**
