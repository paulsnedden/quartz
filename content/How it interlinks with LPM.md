# How it interlinks with [[LPM]] - [[2022-09-19]]
## Notes
• Adaptive organizations are more resilient in the face of change, intentionally focusing on and increasing their 
capacity for learning and innovation.
• They adapt not only their services, products, and business models, but their organizational structures and cultures. 
Adaptive organizations are equally as resilient and creative as the people who work in them.
• Becoming an adaptive organization is not about implementing a framework; it is about an organizational journey 
of evolution.
• This enables –
	• Faster decision making
	• Experimentation mindset
	• Data driven approach
	• Growth mindset
	• Space for people to nurture
	• Overall organisation / system succeed
