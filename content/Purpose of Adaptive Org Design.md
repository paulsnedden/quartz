# Purpose of [[Adaptive Org Design]] - [[2022-09-19]]
## Notes
- Centralized, hierarchical structures worked in the past and continue to work for certain types of organisations. 
However, they are not responsive enough in today’s rapidly changing world for organisations that wish to keep 
pace with and, ideally, stay ahead of their peers.
• In these traditional structures, there is commonly an established power dynamic between managers and 
subordinates where communications, ideas, decisions, etc., flow from the top.
• In a highly volatile and adaptive world, these types of structures cannot respond fast enough and those at the top 
are too far removed from the customer to make the best decisions. 
• Most organisations will become more adaptive by necessity in our increasingly uncertain world. There is no one 
right approach, framework, technique, or method to design an adaptive organisation. Approaches, frameworks, 
techniques, and methods should be intentionally chosen, blended, and tweaked.
• To do this, organisations must not only design for specific business purposes, but also actively design to encourage 
agility in sense-making, learning, and experimentation. The key to making this shift is a willingness to move to a 
more adaptive structure.
• Adaptive organisational designers should be informed and inspired by the principles and ideas of these 
frameworks, not bound by them.
