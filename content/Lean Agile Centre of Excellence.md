# Lean Agile Centre of Excellence - [[2022-09-13]]
## Notes

### What is a [[LACE]]?
The challenge is that most of the people qualified to drive the change have full-time responsibilities in their current roles. While a significant portion of their time can perhaps be devoted to supporting the change, a smaller, more dedicated group of people is required to drive the transformation throughout the organisation. Though these groups go by different names—the Agile Centre of Excellence, Agile Working Group, Lean-Agile Transformation Team, Learning and Improvement Centre—they are all staffed with people whose primary task is to implement the change.
• Communicating the business need, urgency, and vision for change
• Establishing the metrics 
• Conducting or sourcing training for executives, managers and leaders, Agile teams, Facilitating Value Stream Identification 
• Implementing [[Lean Portfolio Management|LPM]]
• Providing coaching and training
