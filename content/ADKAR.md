# ADKAR - [[2023-01-18]]
## Notes
From [[icp-cat]] training
**A**wareness - Of the need to change
**D**esire - To participate and support the change
**K**nowledge - On how to change
**A**bility - To implement desired skills and behaviours
**R**einforcement - To sustain the change

### Awareness
Create Awareness of the need when "Why?" is often asked, by....
- sharing past failures where CM was not effectively applied
- examples of poorly managed change
- research findings
- identify an advocate

### Desire
Often the most difficult, due to "the way we've always done it". People must make their own decision to change, but talking points can be:
- case studies where CM has made an impact
- leverage senior stakeholders

### Knowledge
Awareness and Desire must come before Knowledge, as simply training people in some techniques will ultimately fail. Key talking points are:
- how people experience change
- teach org CM practices and principles
- get the right training and toolkit

### Ability
Acting on the Knowledge that people have acquired during the process. Growing the internal Ability can be discussed as:
- Bi-directional communication
- Time and activities to develop new skills
- Sharing knowledge-based resources
- Get interactive in the Knowledge sessions

### Reinforcement
Once CM is done, ensuring the change "sticks" is key. Actions can include:
- Senior leader buy-in
- Monitor progress and measurement systems
- Celebrate successes
