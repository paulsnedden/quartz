aka [[Minimum Viable Product]]

From: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)
An MVP is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future product development. A focus on releasing an MVP means that developers potentially avoid lengthy and unnecessary work.
