## Activity - The Bluff Game ([[2023-03-01]])
### Description: 
This exercise improves your negotiation skills! In order to win a round, each person will need to interpret someoneâ€™s bluff. Earning the maximum number of points requires the participants to be sharp and focused.

### Setup: 
Each person is given two cards, one that says SPLIT and the other STEAL.

### Actions: 
In pairs, discuss which card to play - SPLIT or STEAL.

Be careful, as your teammate may be bluffing or trying to influence your behaviour.

Once ready, players show their cards.

If both players show SPLIT, they score one point each.
If one player shows SPLIT and the other STEAL, then the STEAL player gets two points.
If both plays show STEAL, they score zero points each.

#### Variation
A third card - YOU ARE A STEALER - is added.
The same rules apply as above. However, there is an additional couple of rules because of this new card.

If one player shows SPLIT and the other shows YOU ARE A STEALER, then the SPLIT player gets two points.
If one player shows STEAL and the other shows YOU ARE A STEALER, then the STEAL player gets two points.
If both players show YOU'RE A STEALER, then both players get zero points.
