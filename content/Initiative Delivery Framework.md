> Initiative Delivery is a holistic process that translates strategic visions into tangible business outcomes. It is an orchestration of interconnected frameworks and processes that embodies two essential principles: "**Doing the Right Things**" (strategic alignment and value proposition) and "**Doing Things Right**" (execution and risk management). Each component of Initiative Delivery plays a specific role in supporting these principles, collaborating to ensure successful initiative execution and value realisation.
