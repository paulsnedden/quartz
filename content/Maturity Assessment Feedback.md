# Maturity Assessment Feedback - [[2023-04-28]]
## Notes
Recently, I asked the MyCEP Tribe to run through an assessment of their ways of working in their squad, and to reflect on how they see themselves working together. 

The assessment was broken into 4 areas:
- Agile Mindset
- Agile Principles
- Agile Practices
- Perceived Maturity and Overall Satisfaction

Below you will find a summary for the <squadname> squad, along with the overall Tribe scores as a point of comparison. Lastly, at the end of each section, I have given my reflection on the results, and to highlight any areas of focus.

Rather than copy all the questions here, you can find them in the assessment by clicking [here]([](https://forms.gle/3DwEnLJMNptF2fFA6))

**Agile Mindset**
This section of the assessment asked squad members to assess their squad against Daniel Pink's *Theory of Motivation* - Mastery, Autonomy and Purpose. Additionally, squad members were asked to assess their squad's level of Psychological Safety and Growth Mindset, both of which are key cultural elements of mature and high-performing teams.

**Agile Principles**
This section details the twelve Principles that are detailed in the Agile Manifesto. The Principles continue to be a great yard stick for whether a squad is "Doing" or "Being" agile.

**Agile Practices**
agile@Woolworths uses a number of delivery frameworks, so rather than trying to assess how well we're adhering to them, this assessment looked at a number of common elements that tend to characterise agile delivery processes. Namely, these were Customer Focus, Product Clarity, Workflow Awareness, Team Dynamics and Delivery Foundations.

**Perceived Maturity and Overall Satisfaction**
The final section of the assessment asked team members about how happy they are with current ways of working: how well those ways of working support efficient and effective delivery, high quality standards, and your team's well-being/motivation.
