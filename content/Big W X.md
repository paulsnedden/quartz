# Big W X - [[2022-02-24]]
## Summary

## Analysis
Nine squads, all using Scrum as their delivery framework. Multiple [[Product Owner]]s per squad, multiple squads per [[Product Owner]].
[[TCS]] is the long-term incumbent across [[Woolworths Group]], with team across Australia and India(Chennai). Big W X have gone from all TCS in 2019 to now only having 1 dev [[Vinitha Ramesh]]. QA, test and support all remain offshore. Dev community is now loaded with [[Upgrowth]] ([[Nick Okunew]]'s business), a couple remain from [[Equal Experts]] (namely, [[Paul Timmins]] and [[Nikita Sharma]]). The rest are from a smattering of new agencies that have been engaged in 2021.

Focus is on replacing [[Hybris]], an antiquated and no longer-supported SAP eCommerce solution. Squads are now focused on removing/replacing components of Hybris with a [[microservice]] solution. However, [[Glenn Horgan]]'s are still very much the primary squads keeping the lights on for Hybris.

VOT scores remain low. I have struggled to get the [[Engineering Leadership]] to see that they are the issue. [[George Georgiou]] in particular is a concern, as the way he communicates to team members is far from ideal. I've spoken with him 1 on 1 a few times, but nothing has changed.

[[Rohan Berry]], whilst an exceptional communicator, pushes on regardless of whether people are on-board with The Plan or not.

The [[Engineering Manager]]s in the team are not technical people by any means. Their focus is on the delivery of widgets and don't seem concerned about the growth or long-term health of their squads.

## High Level Plan
GTFO and leave it to [[Adrian Marando]] to sort out.
