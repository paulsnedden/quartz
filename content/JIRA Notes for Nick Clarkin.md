# Jira Notes for [[Nick Clarkin]]
Date Imported: [[2021-12-07]]

## Notes
======- 9/27/21, 12:45 AM ======-

Not scheduled yet, test, test, Eye on the future but hard to work just one sprint ahead

Not a lot of requirements

design by commitee happens sometimes
doing design with no real requierments
getting better at it
Olly not well versed. Level of IP is hard as most team members are new

Staying focused in sprint events has been good to do., Lorenzo leaving has a big impact on Sonic, but not design per se.

Olly working well w/ team, but needs to focus on progress rather than perfection.
