# The Five [[Scrum]] Values - [[2022-03-23]]
A team’s success with scrum depends on five values: commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect.

## Commitment
- essential for building an agile culture
- teams trust each other to follow through on what they say they are going to do
- When team members aren’t sure how work is going, they ask
- Agile teams only agree to take on tasks they believe they can complete, so they are careful not to overcommit.

## Courage
- teams must feel safe enough to say no, to ask for help, and to try new things.
- teams must be brave enough to question the status quo when it hampers their ability to succeed.

## Focus
- whatever scrum teams start they finish
- teams are relentless about limiting the amount of work in process (limit WIP). 

## Openness
- teams consistently seek out new ideas and opportunities to learn
- teams are also honest when they need help.

## Respect
- team members demonstrate respect to one another
- teams know that their strength lies in how well they collaborate and that everyone has a distinct contribution to make toward completing the work
- respect each other’s ideas, give each other permission to have a bad day once in a while, and recogniae each other’s accomplishments
