# Human Centred Facilitation - [[2022-12-12]]
## Notes
[Meeting Recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g9Gv8CWMYpGUcBqxM_Lo3Kxnbs5DKJLw/view), hosted by [[Steve Lawrence]] with guest speaker, [[James Zhang]]

[[Human centred Facilitation - with James Zhang - (2022-11-10)]] was the meeting invite

## Why is it important?
Time. Everyone is there to get/give value, giving them time to attend.

If you value someone, you give them your time.

## Pitfalls of not being human centred
1. Lack of preparation (no agenda)
2. Shiny-Object syndrome (always wanting the newest thing or not wanting to miss out on discussion)
3. No Timeboxing ([[Parkinson's Law]])
	- If there's too much time allocated, then use it up regardless
	- If there's not enough time, things get rushed and outcomes not achieved
4. Inner Ego (external judgement).
	- "I am better than everyone else"
	- People who don't care for anyone else, except themselves
5. Inner critic (internal judgement)
	- "I am not good enough"
	- Attendees often feed off that energy.
		- Timidness
		- Lack of prep

## Absolute Truth and Our Truth

Who is right?
- Both?
- "It depends"
- Perspective is key

Other Perspectives:
- G
- Open padlock
- An @ symbol
- Broken chain link

Need to be careful about bias towards things. Need unbias / neutrality. Open space to allow for thinking. [[Psychological Safety]] is key, but just because you SAY it doesn't mean it IS.

"Thanks for your ideas, but we need to give other voices a chance"

## Draw a tree in 30 seconds
![[Draw a tree in 30 seconds.png]]
Most people will do a trunk and some leaves, but not the roots. Why?
**We forget about the things that aren't visible.**

In Agile, we _see_ the [[Visual Management Board]] and events, but not the [[Agile Mindset]] and [[Agile Principles]].

What's the [[purpose]] of a tree?
Grow fruit (eg)
That's the **outcome** of the tree. It's the why!

The roots are the **principles** that will guide us

The trunk is the **experience**, the lessons learned, the passage of time

The branches are the **activities** that help us get to the outcome.
