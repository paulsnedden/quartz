## Notes
[[Golden Circle]], from Simon Sinek's [[Start with Why]] talks alot about authenticity.

![[Authenticity means that your Golden Circle is in balance.#^2p72pe]]

![[Being authentic is not a requirement for success, but it is if you want that success to be a lasting success.#^13pble]]

![[Authenticity is when you say and do the things you actually believe.#^x68nrq]]
