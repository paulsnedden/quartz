# Jira Google Forms automation (Code)
og Code by [[Duncan Middlebrook]], documented [here](https://woolworths-agile.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DAI/pages/4221404693/Google+Forms+Jira+Integration)
To be customised per project
I've added additional //comments to make it easier going forward

## To Do
- [x] Additional Formatting and Commenting to make it super easy, barely an inconvenience to implement #task âœ… 2022-01-17

## OG Code 

// This script takes the user inputs from the Google Form, and will create a JIRA issue when the form is submitted via the REST API
// Takes user input info, and passes it into an event parameter "e"

// Requirements before beginning
//    - JIRA Project Key
//    - JIRA User ID (available from [here](https://woolworths-agile.atlassian.net/jira/people/me))
//    - Google Account to send emails from (AppScript MUST be setup from that account)
//    - JIRA API Key (Get API Key from [here](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens), then encode it in the format of emailaddress:apikey by going [here](https://www.base64encode.org/) and record the result)

function createIssue(e){
// Assign variables to the form data submitted by the requestor from the spreadsheet associated with the Google form.
// NOTE: Update the [n] to the cell value in your spreadsheet.
  var reporter = e.values[5];
  var email = e.values[6];
  var summary = e.values[2] + " - " + e.values[4];

  var url = "https://woolworths-agile.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue";
 
 // NOTE: Field Names can be whatever you want.
  var longdescription = "Requestor Name Email: " + e.values[5] + " ("+ e.values[6] + ") \n\n" +
                        "Business Area: " + e.values[1] + "\n\n" +
                        "Business Request: " + e.values[2] + "\n\n" +
                        "Business problem: " + e.values[4] + "\n\n" +
                        "Urgency: " + e.values[3];
  
// The POST data for the JIRA API call

    "fields": {

// Turn all the post data into a JSON string to be send to the API

    "headers": headers,
    "payload": payload

// Make the HTTP call to the JIRA API
//
  var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url, options);

// Parse the JSON response to use the Issue Key returned by the API in the email
//
  var dataAll = JSON.parse(response.getContentText());
  var issueKey = dataAll.key

// Assign variables for the email reposnse

  var emailBody = "Thank you for your ticket submission." + "\n\n" +
    "Your request has been created, your reference is " + issueKey + " which can be accessed via the following link to the JIRA system:" + "\n\n" +
      "https://woolworths-agile.atlassian.net/browse/"+ issueKey + "\n\n" +
       "Your eCom Finance Partner will be in touch soon to discuss your ticket submission.  "
