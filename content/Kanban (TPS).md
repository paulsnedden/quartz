Factories are complicated and busy places – and making sure all work is done can be difficult. That’s where the _[[Kanban]]_, or signboard system, fits into the [[Toyota Production System]].

_**[[Kanban]]**_ (English: Signboard): A system that conveys information between processes and automatically orders parts as they are used up. Every item or box of items that flows through the production process carries its own _[[kanban]]_. _Kanbans_ come off  items that have been used or transported and go back to the preceding processes as orders for additional items

Though literally translated as ‘signboard’, the Toyota-developed method has become known as a clear, sign-based scheduling system triggering the logistical chain of production and maintaining it at an optimal level.

_Kanban_ displays can broadcast lots of different types of information, from stock levels to production volumes. In its simplest form a _[[kanban]]_ board will show goods in, goods in production, and goods out.

Over time, Toyota has evolved this considerably.

_[[Kanban]]_ is the quick-response system through which _**[[Just-In-Time]]**_ production is achieved, harmonising inventory levels with actual consumption. Toyota has six rules for the effective application of _[[Kanban]]_:
			1) Never pass on defective products;
			2) Take only what is needed;
			3) Produce the exact quantity required;
			4) Level the production;
			5) Fine-tune production; and
			6) Stabilise and rationalise the process.

Removing faults (or [[Muda, Muri, Mura]]) from production is central to the [[Toyota Production System]] – another way this happens is through use of the **[[Andon]]**
