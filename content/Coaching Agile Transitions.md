As coach how can you become a true catalyst for change?

In this course, you’ll learn to hold the tension between what an organisation wants, what the individuals within the organisation want, and what the agile values and principles call for. 

This course will build on your existing team coaching skills and extend them to the enterprise. You’ll leverage teaching, mentoring, coaching, and facilitation skills to help the organisation move from their current reality to the agile vision for the future. You’ll gain an understanding of how to think through and understand the implications of changes on team members as well as the collective. You will also be able to generate an agile change plan with a focus on communication, education, and multi-level engagement.
