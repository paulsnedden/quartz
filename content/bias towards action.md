# bias towards action - [[2023-01-12]]
## Notes
A concept introduced to me by [[Marty Ruckert]]

At all times, guide people towards getting things to Done. It's related to that [[Kanban]] meme:
> "[[Stop Starting. Start Finishing]]"

It makes me think of living in the grey.
I'm thinking now about things like [[MVP]] and one of the [[Agile Values]], namely [[Responding to change over following a plan]]. There's more value in putting the actions in-place to start responding to the change, instead of figuring everything out to the Nth degree before starting anything.

[[Cost of Delay]] will become important here.

**Really good** blog post from Tanner Wortham on this topic - https://worth.am/qualities-of-great-agile-coaches/
