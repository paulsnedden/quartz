## Dalai Lama's Guide to Happiness - [[2022-06-01]]

This video looks at 'Buddhism and Happiness', as we ask are they a match made in heaven or something else? This eight minute epic reveals some incredible insights into human behaviour and values that impact our happiness, particularly in this materialistic Western life so many are living, or reaching for. 

The Dalai Lama's talk is from his 'the quest for happiness' public talk in Adelaide during his 'Beyond Religion' tour in Australia.
