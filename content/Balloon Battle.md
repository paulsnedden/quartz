## Activity - Balloon Battle ([[2022-07-25]])
### Description: 
Get everyone moving while creating a situation to introduce some concepts - team strategy, teamwork, collaboration, partnership.

### Setup: 
Balloons (enough of the same colour for the number of participants in a "team". eg If 8 people, go with 4 teams of 2 people. Therefore 4 different coloured balloons, and need four of each)
String, to tie balloons to peoples ankles
CAN be run with any size team

### Actions: 
1. Divide the team into pairs (or triads/quartets/quintets, depending on the size of the group)
2. For each team, give each team-member 2 balloons (same colour for all in the team) and ask them to blow them up.
3. Give each team enough string to tie one balloon to each of their ankles (1 per ankle)
4. Instruct the team:
		"All teams have the same goal - **protect the team balloons**. The game lasts X minutes. At the end, we will count and announce the team with the highest number of unpopped balloons."
5. Say "GO!" and let the carnage begin.

At the end of the game and the winner is announced, the conversation is them about teamwork, team strategy, perception of responsibility, and of course, the human nature of competition.
