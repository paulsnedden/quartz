# What does good [[Design Thinking]] look like - [[2022-11-01]]
## Notes
1. Setup a team of trained facilitators, constantly educated on techniques, allowing for tailored Workshops that actually meet needs and not cookie cutter approach
2. Never do top-down innovation. Start with a small team, get them really good, then they show/prove it to the rest of the business.
3. Expect that it will take time.
