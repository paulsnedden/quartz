## Notes

Synergy is the principle that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Highly effective people are able to create synergy by working together with others and combining their strengths.

To synergize, you need to:

- Be open to new ideas and perspectives.
- Be willing to share your own ideas and perspectives.
- Be willing to work together to achieve a common goal.
