## Notes
### Adaptive Portfolio in [[Lean Portfolio Management]]

Very similar to what [[Rohan Berry]] put together for [[BigWX]]
Makes me wonder if he's SaFE trained

### Key parameters for Adaptive Portfolio
• All items in a portfolio have a clear lifecycle, with necessary governance checkpoints.
• Some initiatives will be highly experimental and should have planning cycles measured in days and weeks.
• Even with long roadmaps, three months should be the longest planning horizon for almost any initiative as the reality is that the cascading uncertainty in longer planning cycles will likely cause massive change pressure.
• The portfolio backlog is a regularly reviewed pipeline of new work and existing initiatives.
• Rank items in the portfolio against each other based on potential and actual value, cost (of delay, necessity, and compliance), risk of doing and of not doing (business and technical), available skills, and capability to deliver.

- **Outcomes** over outputs
- **Value** over size
- **Efficient Operation** over Complex Structures
- **Ownership** over Ambiguity
