# Delivering value early and often over waiting for perfection - [[2022-11-15]]
## Notes
Source: https://agilemarketingmanifesto.org/

Rather than waiting for everything to be 'perfect' we begin delivering value to our customers early in the cycle. We continue to deliver value based on learnings from our previous program and so-on...

When we wait for 'perfect' we remove the chances to learn from our customers so we can deliver more value later on. Instead, striving for perfection leads to long production cycles and a big-bang approach.
