# Responding to change over following a static plan - [[2022-11-15]]
## Notes
Source: https://agilemarketingmanifesto.org/

This value is a derivative from the original [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/) published by the developers back in 2001.

Our slight change of adding the word 'static' helps it relate a bit better to the marketing world. If we are unable to deviate from a rigid plan when a buyer/market/global change occurs, then we risk under-serving our audiences and reaping poor outcomes.
