# Heart of Agile - [[2023-02-06]]
## Notes

You want to change the world.

Whatever your initiative, it involves changing the world just a little bit. The world, however, is remarkably resistant to interventions. The best ideas fail because of misunderstandings of how the world will react, or because of errors in implementation.

THESE FOUR WORDS HELP YOU DO IT.

### Collaborate

closely with others to generate and develop better starting ideas. Communicate often to smooth transitions.

### Deliver

small probes initially to learn how the world really works. Expand deliveries as you learn to predict and influence outcomes.

### Reflect

periodically, along the way. Think about what you've learned in your collaboration and from your deliveries.

### Improve

the direction of your ideas, their technical implementation, and your internal processes.
