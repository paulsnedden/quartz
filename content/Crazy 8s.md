## Activity - Crazy 8's ([[2022-11-01]])
### Description: 
Crazy 8s is an activity that we run as part of every Design Sprint, but it can be used anytime you want to come up with a bunch of ideas quickly. The simplicity of this one is wonderful:

1. Grab a piece of paper and fold it into eight sections
2. Set a timer for 8 minutes
3. Have participants sketch a distinct idea in each section. (Remind them that the ideas donâ€™t have to be amazing, or even viable. The point is getting ideas down on paper and not censoring themselves.)
