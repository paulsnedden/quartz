**Value Stream Budgets** – The executive team identifies funding for each value stream. Lean budgeting and allocating work by value streams provide the scrum teams the independence, flexibility and speed to deliver quality products to the customer. Lean budgets and value streams allow teams to pivot as client requirements change. Dedicated scrum teams assigned to value streams are more productive, predictable and responsive, and tend to deliver higher-quality work.

**Budget Guardrails** – Establishing guardrails at the executive and portfolio levels helps the organization monitor and govern the value stream budgets and methods of spending. It ensures that there is a balance across portfolio work categories. Budget guardrails also allows the organization to identify when a portfolio-level approval review for bigger portfolio work items is required before the items are assigned to teams.

**Portfolio Intake Process and Prioritization** – The portfolio management team reviews all requests using a [[Kanban (TPS)]] board process, which determines what should happen with the portfolio intake request. The team decides the priority of the request and whether it requires more analysis and approval at the portfolio level, should be cancelled or deferred, or can be sent directly to the [[scrum]] teams to manage.

**Value Stream Initiatives** – Initiatives in the portfolio backlog are executed through value streams that build the product or service that delivers customer value. Value stream initiatives are assigned to teams to execute. The portfolio team ensures initiatives have the proper details and meet the “[[definition of ready]],” so teams have the information they need 
to properly conduct their [[sprint planning]] session.

**[[Participatory Budgeting]]** – The value stream budget owners meet regularly to revisit budget allocations and ensure the proper amount of funding exists to address new initiatives and/or critical customer needs that arise unexpectedly.

Portfolio Metrics and Governance – The executive team tracks investment returns versus spend to see if any adjustments are needed. the LPM tracks portfolio-level metrics (i.e., initiatives, features) to see if the work that teams are delivering addresses the customers needs and provides positive outcomes. Dependencies that cannot be addressed at the team level are escalated to the portfolio level.
