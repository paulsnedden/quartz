## Activity - Magic Triangles ([[2022-07-25]])
### Description: 
From book, *Fun Retrospectives*
A great energiser, being useful for starting a conversation about self-organising teams.

### Setup: 
Select one participant to be the Manager (for Phase 1 only)
Move/remove any furniture from the room to create an open space

### Actions: 
Phase 1 (Traditional, Manager-led organisation):
* Get everyone in the room to stand up and walk around the room in random directions
* Say the magic word, "Triangle"
* All participants stop moving and the Manager then organises the participants into groups of 3 (a "triangle")
* Track how long it takes

Phase 2 (Agile, self-organising)
* Same as Phase 1, but no Manager
