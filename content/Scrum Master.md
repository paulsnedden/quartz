### Medium Article
I’ve compiled a list of 10 tips that come to my mind for fresh Scrum Masters.

1. Don’t rush! Learn to slow down. It will take time. Turning theoretical knowledge into practice is not easy. It may take months to feel that it’s working and beneficial. Don’t panic, don’t feel bad about yourself; keep learning and practising.

2. Be a good observer, an active listener. Identify the current situation and the need.

3. Stay open to continuous learning. The learning process never ends. At the point where you say, “I’m an expert now,” new information, articles, and applications related to that topic will emerge to challenge what you know.

4. Remember, Agile is just a framework; don’t forget there are shades of grey. You won’t be able to say, “This is the right way” for any approach or method. Navigate the grey areas and find the tone that suits your team.

5. You’ll work with people who don’t know or misinterpret your job. Don’t be surprised. Remember, everyone has the right not to know certain things. You also have the right to explain. When you encounter such a person, put on your educator hat and teach them what your job is and what it isn’t.

6. You don’t have to be a software expert. If you’re eager to learn what your team does, this job is for you. Put on your coaching hat and guide your team with powerful questions.

7. Don’t be ashamed of what you don’t know. You can’t know everything about Agile. After all, there will always be something new. Saying “I don’t know” is a sign of respect for those who do.

8. Remember, the foundation of Agile is experimentation. Try, fail, try differently.

9. You can’t fix all the problems at once. Prioritise and focus one at a time.

10. Don’t get too caught up in certification. Having a certification without experience won’t mean much.
