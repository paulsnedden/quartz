# 1-2-4-Silent All - [[2023-06-02]]
## Notes
A riff on [[1-2-4-All]] from [[Liberating Structures]]
1-2-4-Silent All was demo'd by Tanner Wortham during a [Miro Talk](https://go2.miro.com/Successfull_Sprint_and_Retros-Registration-On-Demand.html)

His Miro template is [here](https://miro.com/miroverse/124silent-all-1/)
> The 1-2-4-Silent All is a facilitation technique that focuses on the problem space. It can work with any team size, although 8 to 16 is its sweet spot.
> It begins with silent reflection to answer a prompt, then breaks teams into pairs to discuss and pick the best ideas, merges pairs into quads for further refinement and then utilizes silent negotiation to arrive at the most important 2 or 3 problem areas.

Using [[Powerful Questions]] will be important here, to get the prompt right.

### Steps
(2 mins) Provide the prompt and rules.
(2 mins) Have group silently provide two answers to the prompt.
(3 mins) Breakout into pairs. Discuss and decide on the best two of their four answers.
(4 mins) Pairs become quads and decide on the best two of their four answers.
(4 mins) Group comes together as whole and silently stack ranks. 

### Comments
In-short, when the Top 4 responses are known, then line them up and get the team, inturns, to swap 2 adjacent tickets. ie 1 and 2, 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

If 1 and 2 are constantly switched, that's fine. You've got the two most important things.

If 3 and 4 are constantly switched, that's fine. It means they agree that 1 and 2 are the most important.

If 2 and 3 are constantly switched, that's fine. It means they agree that 1 is the most important. Maybe bring in top 3 for next round.
