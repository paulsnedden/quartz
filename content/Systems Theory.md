## Notes
also see [[Systems Thinking]]

The systems theory of organisation is a theory that organisations are composed of many subsystems that arenâ€™t necessarily related to one another and yet work together to form the whole. This theory is helpful for understanding things like [[organisational behaviour]], [[organisational change]] and [[organisational development]]. Systems theory allows for an understanding of the connections between various parts of the organisation and how they interact with one another.

Each subsystem has an INPUT, a PROCESS and an OUTPUT.
