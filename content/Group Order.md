## Activity - Group Order ([[2022-09-13]])
### Description: 
Group Order
Supporting the get-to-know process at the start of a session or with a new team can be as simple as asking participants to group themselves together based on what they know about each other and inviting them to find out what they don’t.

### Setup: 
This activity requires nothing more than getting your group together in a room and asking them to line themselves up in an order based on a criterion such as distance from home to the workplace, birth date in the calendar year or number of different countries visited. 

### Actions: 
You’ll be surprised at how easy it is to get people talking and sharing when in pursuit of a common goal.
