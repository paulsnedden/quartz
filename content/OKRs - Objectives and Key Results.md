OKRs have been popularly adopted by companies such as Spotify, Twitter, Airbnb, LinkedIn, Samsung, Microsoft, Amazon, Colgate, Walmart, Anheuser-Busch, Target, Gap, GE, Dun&Bradstreet, and ING Bank. 

Objectives & Key Results (OKR) is a goal management & execution system that contains no more than 3-5 Objectives & no more than 3-5 Key Results for each objective.

[[Developing OKRs]]

It has 3 major components viz. 
**Objectives** where do you want to go?
**Key results** how will you know you are getting there and how will you measure success?
**Initiatives** what will you do to get there?
