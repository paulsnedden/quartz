Similar to [[Liberating Structures]]' [[Conversation Cafe]]

### Design Principles
1. Clarify the context
2. Create hospitable space
3. Explore questions that matter
4. Encourage everyone's participation
5. Connect diverse perspectives
6. Listen together for patterns and insights
7. Share collective discoveries

### Method
#### Setting
Create a “special” environment, most often modelled after a café, i.e. small round tables covered with a chequered or white linen tablecloth, butcher block paper, coloured pens, a vase of flowers, and optional “talking stick” item. There should be four chairs at each table (optimally) – and no more than five.

#### Welcome and Introduction
The host begins with a warm welcome and an introduction to the World Café process, setting the context, sharing the Cafe Etiquette, and putting participants at ease.

#### Small group rounds
The process begins with the first of three or more twenty-minute rounds of conversation for small groups of four (five maximum) people seated around a table. At the end of the twenty minutes, each member of the group moves to a different new table. They may or may not choose to leave one person as the “table host” for the next round, who welcomes the next group and briefly fills them in on what happened in the previous round.

#### Questions
Each round is prefaced with a question specially crafted for the specific context and desired purpose of the World Café. The same questions can be used for more than one round, or they may build upon each other to focus the conversation or guide its direction.

#### Harvest
After the small groups (and/or in between rounds, as needed), individuals are invited to share insights or other results from their conversations with the rest of the large group. These results are reflected visually in a variety of ways, most often using graphic recording in the front of the room.
