Working in an open-plan environment is what _Genba_ is all about.

_**Genba**_ or _**Gemba**_ (English: The real place, the place where the actual work is done): Now adapted in management terminology to mean the ‘workplace’ or the place where value is added. In manufacturing, it usually refers to the shop floor.

Within Toyota, the philosophy of _Genba_ means that all actions and processes are as transparent as possible

This visibility allows Toyota team members  to conduct regular _**Genba Walks**_ in order to identify areas where potential improvements might be made, and to better understand the workload of their colleagues.

Walks around the frontline environment of the _Genba_ also help to reinforce [[Kaizen]]… The philosophy of [[continuous improvement]].

The _Genba_ is the most important location in a Toyota factory – a place where time, productivity and space are crucial and not to be wasted. Read about [[Muda, Muri, Mura]] – different kinds of waste.
