Not from [[Lean Portfolio Management]] but was mentioned in [[Agile Visa ICP-LPM Online Certification (Aug 15-18th)  - (2022-08-16)]] [[ICP-LPM]]
From [[How Great Leaders Inspire Action]] TED talk by Simon Sinek
**WHY**
**HOW**
**WHAT**

Every organisation knows WHAT they do/make/sell.
Lesser organisations know HOW they do/make/sell.
Fewer still know WHY.

eg If Apple sold "traditionally" as "WHAT - HOW - WHY" then their claim could be "We make great computers.....they are beautifully designed and have great features....wanna buy one?"
Flip that to WHY - HOW - WHAT and you get "Everything we do comes from our belief of challenging the status quo. in thinking differently......we do this by making our products beautifully designed and have great features....we just happen to make great computers. Wanna buy one?"
