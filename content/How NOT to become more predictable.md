# Agile Anti-Patterns - [[2023-02-06]]
## Notes
How NOT to become "more predictable" as an agile team:

* Big-batches
* Work in silos and individual projects
* Pack quarters like a Tetris board
* Start new things when you're blocked
* Parallelize work, and integrate later
* Treat your work as too precious to share
* Converge quickly on a plan
* Lock down designs upstream
* Invest more time in estimation
* Pressure teams to commit to deadlines
* Dedicate all energy to "the project"
* Ship and move on
* Visualise work against a calendar
* Worry about predictability. Make predictability the goal
