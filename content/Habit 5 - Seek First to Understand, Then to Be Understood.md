# Habit 5 - Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood - [[2023-09-20]]
## Notes

Highly effective people are good listeners. They take the time to understand the other person's point of view before sharing their own. This helps them to build stronger relationships and resolve conflict more effectively.

To seek first to understand, you need to:

- Listen actively and pay attention to what the other person is saying.
- Ask clarifying questions.
- Be empathetic and try to see things from the other person's perspective.
