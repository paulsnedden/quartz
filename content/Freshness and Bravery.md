# Freshness and Bravery - [[2023-01-10]]
From: [[Embedding a Culture of Innovation]]

## Freshness
How often, when going to a restaurant, do we read the menu, listen to the specials, and then order the same thing we always do?

How often, when driving home, do we go the same path without even thinking about it?

How do we change our [[Rivers of Thinking]] to allow for Freshness? How do we [[Think Different]]?

## Bravery
What is the bravest animal in the jungle? Most will say the Lion. I would say the Butterfly, the one that consumes your stomach in a complete and utter sense of total panic.

You don't need to feel that way every day, or even every month. But, when you do, it's because you're doing something different.

> The opposite of Bravery isn't Cowardice...it's **Conformity**
