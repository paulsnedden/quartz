## How to ask better questions - [[2022-06-02]]

How can humanity increase its capacity to make decisions in an increasingly complex world? In this informative talk, thinking rethinker Mike Vaughan shares insights from his practice helping leaders solve big problems with the power of a good question.

Mike has taken a lifelong passion for learning and thinking processes and used it to create industry-leading research around the analysis of how high-value leaders think, how their thinking is different from their colleagues’, and how it ultimately makes them more successful. He is the author of “The End of Training: How Simulations Are Reshaping Business,” and the recently published book, “The Thinking Effect: Rethinking Thinking to Create Great Leaders and the New Value Worker.” Mike is a managing director and CEO of The Regis Company, a privately held company that applies neuroscience principles to custom leadership programs and business simulations. Since he co-founded the company in 2003, The Regis Company has become a globally recognized leader in simulation design, winning virtually every top award and honor in the industry.
