## Context Switching
### Description: 
Context-switching is where someone stops one task half way through to do something else, then comes back to the task; it's a big problem - research has shown that a 5 minute interruption for a developer can result in 45 minutes or more of lost productivity as they are taken out of "the zone" and struggle to get back in afterwards. This activity introduces that concept to a team in a very simple way, using 2 and 3x tables

### Setup: 
Players need pen and paper.

### Actions: 
The game is played in 3 rounds. In round one, players are asked to write down their 2x tables (just the answers....2,4,6,8,etc). In round 2, players are asked to write down their 3x tables (3,6,9,12,etc). In round 3, players are asked to write down the alternating answers to the 2x and 3x tables. eg 2,3,5,6,4,9,6,12,8,15, etc.

Each round lasts for 10 seconds.
After rounds 1 and 2, ask players to share how far they got.
After round 3, ask players to share how far they got across both times tables and open up discussion around "why" the results are so different to rounds 1 and 2

#### Alternatives
##### To make it much harder, use 1, 2, 3, 4 and combine it with A, B, C, D and i, ii, iii, iv
