# Habit 4 - Think Win-Win - [[2023-09-20]]
## Notes

Highly effective people seek mutually beneficial solutions in all of their interactions. They believe that everyone can win, and they are willing to work together to achieve a win-win outcome.

To think win-win, you need to:

- Be open to other people's ideas and perspectives.
- Be willing to compromise.
- Focus on the long-term benefits of a relationship.
