# Cross-Functional Collaboration Over Silos & Hierarchies - [[2022-11-15]]
## Notes
Source: https://agilemarketingmanifesto.org/

Collaboration, focused on the needs of the customer, produces better marketing than siloed, departmental turf wars and strict adherence to hierarchical decision making.

Silos lead to tribal knowledge dying in a marketing organization which leads to deviation from the customer needs.
