> Do you remember that feeling as a child when you knew how to have fun?

As an adult, you want to feel it again, but you can’t seem to have that “fun” feeling anymore.

You even do the things that are supposed to be fun, but you can’t seem to enjoy life like a child anymore.

**So you daydream about those good old days and return to the reality.**

I know you may think having fun in life is a thing of the past, but I assure you, it’s possible to have fun, even when you have so many responsibilities and things to worry about.

While [learning to relax](https://designepiclife.com/how-to-be-at-peace/) is an art in itself, having fun in life is another. One of the biggest reasons we can’t seem to have fun in life is that we don’t even know what brings true joy to us.

> So we keep drifting between activities other people enjoy, and then we wonder why we can’t enjoy those activities as much as they do.

But after today, you won’t have to do the guesswork. You’ll know exactly what to do to have fun — whenever you want.

## The Importance Of Play

> “The most successful adults maintain the ability to play.” — Dr. Jack Shonkoff

Before I lay out how you can have fun for your individual personality, let’s establish why you should care about playing.

**You may think playing is for kids. You may believe playing is optional as an adult. But the reality is — you need play. It’s like food for your soul.**

Today, more people are play deprived than ever before. The [consequences of chronic play deprivation](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Consequences_of_Play_Deprivation) include:

-   Lack of brain growth
-   Increased risk of depression
-   Increased risk of addictive behavior
-   Malfunctioning of vital brain areas
-   Poor impulse control
-   Poor anger management
-   Poor self-regulation
-   Fragile and shallow relationships

On the flip side, Greg McKeown, the author of the book [Essentialism](https://designepiclife.com/essentialism), says **play increases our brain activity, reduces stress and opens our minds to see alternative options.**

How do you bring play back into your life?

I’m glad you asked.

## Discover Your Play Personality

Dr. Stuart Brown, the author of the book [Play](https://designepiclife.com/play), identified 8 “play personalities” based on animal and human natural behaviors.

**While we all are a mix of these play personalities, we usually have one or more dominant ones. Also, your play personality may shift as you age, so always be open to experimenting when you can’t seem to have fun in life.**

Knowing your current or dominant play personality can help you identify the activities that will bring true joy into your life and make you feel fully alive.

**The 8 play personalities are:**

## The Power Of Deep Play

You may have heard about [deep work](https://designepiclife.com/deepwork). But “deep play” is also necessary to experience an amazing life.

The more clear you are about what fun means to you, the more you will spend time in deep play and avoid the things you don’t enjoy.

**The easiest way to identify your deep play activities is to notice what makes you forget the notion of time. Remembering the activities you loved as a child may also help you identify them.**

Deep work and deep play go hand in hand. Sometimes, they merge into one activity and other times, they complement each other and [manage your energy](https://designepiclife.com/boost-energy/) by giving you [optimal stress](https://designepiclife.com/train-your-mind/) and recovery.

So to use the full power of deep work and deep play, you may juggle between the two to maintain a balance. Or you can choose a field of work that allows you to do both simultaneously.

**When you have to juggle between deep work and deep play**, and you don’t have time for a deep play session, you can call in “micro play” sessions.

-   _The Joker_ may crack a joke or watch funny content
-   _The Kinesthete_ may take a short walk
-   _The Explorer_ may “Google” something to satisfy their curiosity
-   _The Competitor_ may play a short session of a game
-   _The Director_ may organize files or tasks
-   _The Collector_ may keep a list of relevant links or resources
-   _The Artist/Creator_ may doodle on a paper, hum a song, and so on (depends on the art).
-   _The Storyteller_ may daydream a story

**The other option is to perform deep work and deep play simultaneously** when your work fits your play personality style.

As James Michener said…

> “The master in the art of living makes little distinction between his work and his play, his labor and his leisure, his mind and his body, his information and his recreation, his love and his religion. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence at whatever he does, leaving others to decide whether he is working or playing. To him, he’s always doing both.”
