Eliminating [[waste]] is the key to efficiency – in the [[Toyota Production System]], this is termed as _Muda_, _Muri_ and _Mura_. Read on to see our explanation.

Muda means [[waste]] and refers in management terms to a wide range of non-value-adding activities. Eliminating [[waste]] is one of the main principles of the [[Just-In-Time]] system, the main pillar of the [[Toyota Production System]]. Considered as [[waste]] are unnecessary financing costs, storage costs, worthless stock of old items etc. Muda of overproduction and Muda of Inventory are the most common ones. 

Toyota divides _Muda_ into seven resources that are frequently wasted: 1) Transportation — a cost that adds no value to the product but increases the risk of a product being damaged, lost or delayed; 2) Inventory — a capital outlay that if not processed immediately produces no income; 3) Motion — any damage inflicted through the production process, such as normal wear and tear in equipment, repetitive stress injuries, or by unforeseen accidents; 4) Waiting — products that are not in transport or being processed; 5) Over-processing — when more work is done than necessary, or when tools are more complex, precise or expensive than necessary; 6) Over-production — larger batches or more products being made than is required; and 7) Defects — the loss involved in rectifying faulty parts or products. See [[D.O.W.N.T.I.M.E.]] for more.

_**Muri**_ (_English: Overburden_): Eliminating overburden of equipment and people is one of the main principles of the [[Just-In-Time]] system, the main pillar of the [[Toyota Production System]]. To avoid overburden, production is evenly distributed in the assembly processes.

It is the second of three types of waste highlighted within the [[Toyota Production System]], requiring the balancing of manufacturing pace to allow members sufficient time to achieve the correct standard of work. A reduced time frame will be too burdensome to achieve the objective, while the allowing of too much time is a [[waste]] of resource.

(Related: **_[[Takt Time]]_** \[derived from German word _Taktzeit_, or ‘cycle time’\] — matching the pace of production with customer demand and the available work time).

_**Mura**_ (_English: Unevenness or irregularity_): Eliminating unevenness or irregularities in the production process is one of the main principles of the [[Just-In-Time]] system, the main pillar of the [[Toyota Production System]].

The third of three types of waste mentioned within the [[Toyota Production System]], notably identified and levelled through the application of _[[Heijunka]]_ principles and _[[Kanban (TPS)]]_ devices. Workflow is also smoothed by requiring members to operate multiple machines — also known as ‘multi-process handling’ — within any particular process, and by predicting and preparing for times of high demand.

The quest for ultimate efficiency is also embodied in a _[[Poka-Yoke]]_, or mistake-proofing, mechanism.
